A FitBit Smartwatch app to track in a very simplistic way when your baby slept or ate the last time.
Swipe left/right to change the screens.
All data is stored on the watch. Current feed/sleep + the last 10 entries.

1. Main screen:

The display shows several data:

- the last time you logged a baby feed or sleep time
- the elapsed time since the last logged feed or sleep start/end

You can log a feed by the upper right combo button.
You can start / end a sleep log by the lower right combo button.

2. Sleep log:

- start and end time of the sleep
- the duration

3. Feed log

- time of the feed
- the time elapsed since the last feed before

DISCLAIMER:

I wrote this very quickly for exactly my needs. Feel free to build on my simple code that can be found at https://github.com/tanstaaflFH/BabyLog
